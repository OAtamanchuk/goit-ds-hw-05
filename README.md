## Description
This repository contains a homework assignment focused on data analysis using the Pandas library in Python.

The project is divided into three main parts:
1. Working with tabular data obtained from online sources.
2. Analysis and cleaning of survey data stored in CSV format.
3. Exploratory data analysis of a real-world dataset from Kaggle.

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Functionality
### Part 1 Introduction to Pandas
- Reading HTML tables using read_html
- Exploring datasets using head, shape, and dtypes
- Data cleaning:
  - replacing missing values
  - type conversion
  - handling NaN values
- Filtering and selecting data
- Calculating descriptive statistics
- Identifying regions with above-average values
- Visualization of birth rate data using bar charts

### Part 2 CSV File Analysis
- Reading and exploring CSV data
- Handling missing values and dropping incomplete columns and rows
- Filtering data by programming language
- Grouping and aggregating data using groupby
- Calculating minimum, maximum, and average salary values
- Creating new calculated columns
- Saving processed data to a CSV file

### Part 3 Kaggle Dataset Analysis
- Reading and preprocessing a real-world dataset
- Renaming columns to snake_case format
- Exploratory data analysis:
  - checking for missing values
  - analyzing distributions
  - identifying unique categories
- Sorting and filtering data based on multiple conditions
- Grouping and aggregation by genre and author
- Combining multiple DataFrames and sorting results

### Visualization
- Creation of multiple visualizations for each notebook
- Usage of different chart types and styles
- Customization of plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn
